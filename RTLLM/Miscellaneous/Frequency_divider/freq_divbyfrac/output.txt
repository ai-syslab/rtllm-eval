A frequency divider that divides the input clock frequency by fractional values. It generates a clock signal with a fractional frequency division (3.5x), using the double-edge clocking technique to achieve half-integer division while adjusting for duty cycle imbalance. By dividing uneven clock cycles and phase-shifting them, a smooth fractional clock output is produced.

Module name: 
    freq_divbyfrac

Input ports:
    clk: Input clock signal.
    rst_n: Active low reset signal to initialize the module.
    
Output ports:
    clk_div: Fractionally divided clock output.

Implementation:
The module performs fractional frequency division by counting clock cycles and generating an intermediate divided clock signal. For 3.5x division:
The counter cycles through 7 clock cycles (MUL2_DIV_CLK = 7).
It generates two uneven clock periods: one with 4 source clock cycles and another with 3 source clock cycles.
In the next cycle, phase-shifted versions of the divided clock are generated. One phase is delayed by half a clock period, and the other is advanced by half a clock period.
Finally, the two intermediate clocks are logically OR-ed to produce the final fractional divided clock output, ensuring the divided clock signal has a uniform period.

Give me the complete code.
